//! `Envoy` `Network Filter` extension.
//!
//! Creating a new `Network Filter` extension using `Envoy SDK` consists of the following steps:
//!
//! 1. Implement [`NetworkFilter`] trait to define core logic of your extension
//! 2. Implement [`ExtensionFactory`] trait to create new instances of your extension
//! 3. [`Register`] your extension on WebAssembly module start up
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! #### Basic [`NetworkFilter`]:
//!
//! ```
//! # use envoy_sdk as envoy;
//! use envoy::extension::NetworkFilter;
//!
//! /// My very own `NetworkFilter`.
//! struct MyNetworkFilter;
//!
//! impl NetworkFilter for MyNetworkFilter {}
//! ```
//!
//! #### `ExtensionFactory` for `MyNetworkFilter` instances:
//!
//! ```
//! # use envoy_sdk as envoy;
//! # use envoy::extension::NetworkFilter;
//! #
//! # /// My very own `NetworkFilter`.
//! # struct MyNetworkFilter;
//! #
//! # impl NetworkFilter for MyNetworkFilter {}
//! #
//! use envoy::extension::{ExtensionFactory, InstanceId, Result};
//!
//! /// `ExtensionFactory` for `MyNetworkFilter`.
//! struct MyNetworkFilterFactory;
//!
//! impl ExtensionFactory for MyNetworkFilterFactory {
//!     type Extension = MyNetworkFilter;
//!
//!     fn name() -> &'static str { "my_network_filter" }
//!
//!     fn new_extension(&mut self, _instance_id: InstanceId) -> Result<Self::Extension> {
//!         Ok(MyNetworkFilter)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! #### Registration of `MyNetworkFilter` on start up:
//!
//! ```
//! # use envoy_sdk as envoy;
//! # use envoy::extension::NetworkFilter;
//! #
//! # /// My very own `NetworkFilter`.
//! # struct MyNetworkFilter;
//! # impl NetworkFilter for MyNetworkFilter {}
//! #
//! # use envoy::extension::{ExtensionFactory, InstanceId, self};
//! #
//! # /// `ExtensionFactory` for `MyNetworkFilter`.
//! # struct MyNetworkFilterFactory;
//! #
//! # impl ExtensionFactory for MyNetworkFilterFactory {
//! #     type Extension = MyNetworkFilter;
//! #
//! #     fn name() -> &'static str { "my_network_filter" }
//! #
//! #     fn new_extension(&mut self, _instance_id: InstanceId) -> Result<Self::Extension> {
//! #         Ok(MyNetworkFilter)
//! #     }
//! # }
//! use envoy::extension::{entrypoint, Module, Result};
//!
//! entrypoint! { initialize } // put initialization logic into a function to make it unit testable
//!
//! fn initialize() -> Result<Module> {
//!     Module::new()
//!         .add_network_filter(|_instance_id| Ok(MyNetworkFilterFactory))
//! }
//! ```

/// ```
/// # use envoy_sdk as envoy;
